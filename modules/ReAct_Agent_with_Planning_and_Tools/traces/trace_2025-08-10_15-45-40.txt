[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the database migration failed due to a schema version mismatch. This type of error typically occurs when the database schema version expected by the migration script does not match the current version of the database.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the database schema is updated to the correct version before attempting the migration again. However, the tools available do not directly address schema version mismatches. This issue usually requires manual intervention to update the schema or adjust the migration script.

Since the tools provided do not include options for handling schema version mismatches, I recommend the following steps outside of the toolset:

1. **Check the Current Schema Version**: Verify the current schema version in the database.
2. **Update the Schema**: If the schema is outdated, update it to the expected version required by the migration script.
3. **Review Migration Script**: Ensure that the migration script is compatible with the current schema version.

Once these steps are completed, you can rerun the migration process. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
