[2] USER: Analyze this CI/CD failure and use the appropriate tools to fix it:

üîç Jenkins Log:

        [12:05:...


[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the deployment process failed because port 443 is already in use. This is a common issue when a service is trying to bind to a port that is already occupied by another process.

To resolve this issue, we need to free up port 443 so that the deployment can proceed without any port conflicts.

I will use the `free_port` tool to release port 443.

[4] TOOL RESULT: port 443 freed


[5] AI REASONING:
Port 443 has been successfully freed. You can now proceed with the deployment process again, and it should no longer encounter the port conflict issue. If there are any further problems, please let me know!
