[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the deployment to staging failed due to "Insufficient disk space." This suggests that the server or environment where the deployment is being attempted does not have enough disk space to complete the operation.

To resolve this issue, we need to free up disk space. However, since freeing disk space is not directly supported by the available tools, we need to consider alternative solutions. Unfortunately, the tools provided do not include a direct method to free up disk space.

Given the constraints, I recommend checking the server manually to free up disk space by removing unnecessary files or increasing the disk space allocation if possible. If you have any other specific tools or methods to manage disk space, those should be utilized.

If you have any other specific actions or tools that can be used to manage disk space, please let me know!
