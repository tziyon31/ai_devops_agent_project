[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the deployment to staging failed due to "Insufficient disk space." This suggests that the server or environment where the deployment is being attempted does not have enough disk space to complete the operation.

To resolve this issue, we need to free up disk space. However, since there is no direct tool available to free up disk space, we need to consider alternative solutions or actions that might indirectly address the issue, such as cleaning up old files or logs, or increasing disk space if possible.

Since the tools provided do not include a direct method to increase disk space or clean up files, we are unable to directly resolve this issue with the available tools. The best course of action would be to manually clean up disk space on the server or increase the disk allocation if possible.

If you have any other specific actions or tools available for disk management, please let me know!
