[1] SYSTEM: Instructions provided

[2] USER: Analyze this CI/CD failure and use the appropriate tools to fix it:

üîç Jenkins Log:
Database connect...


[4] TOOL RESULT: timeout detected


[5] AI REASONING:
The log indicates two issues:
1. Database connection failed.
2. A timeout was detected.

To address these issues, I will:
1. Increase the timeout duration to handle the timeout problem.
2. Since the database connection failure might be related to a port issue, I will also free up a commonly used database port (e.g., port 5432 for PostgreSQL).

Let's proceed with these actions.

[6] TOOL RESULT: timeout increased

[7] TOOL RESULT: port 5432 freed


[8] AI REASONING:
I have increased the timeout duration and freed up port 5432, which is commonly used for database connections. These actions should help resolve the database connection failure and the timeout issue. Please rerun the CI/CD pipeline to verify if the problems are resolved.
