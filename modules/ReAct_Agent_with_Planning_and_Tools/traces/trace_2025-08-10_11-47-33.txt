        [15:30:...


[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that there is a "Connection refused" error on port 5432, which is commonly used by PostgreSQL databases. This suggests that the port might be occupied or the database service is not running.

To resolve this issue, we should attempt to free up port 5432. If the port is occupied by another process, freeing it should allow the database connection to succeed.

Let's proceed with freeing up port 5432.

[4] TOOL RESULT: port 5432 freed


[5] AI REASONING:
The port 5432 has been successfully freed. This should resolve the "Connection refused" error. You can now rerun the unit tests to verify that the issue is resolved. Would you like me to rerun the tests for you?
