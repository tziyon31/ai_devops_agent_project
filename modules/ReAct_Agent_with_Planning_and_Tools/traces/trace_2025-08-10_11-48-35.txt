[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the unit tests are failing due to a "Connection refused" error on port 5432. This suggests that the port is either not open or is already in use by another process, preventing the database connection.

To resolve this issue, we should free up port 5432 to ensure that the database can establish a connection. Let's proceed with freeing the port.

[4] TOOL RESULT: port 5432 freed


[5] AI REASONING:
The port 5432 has been successfully freed. This should resolve the "Connection refused" error. You can now rerun the unit tests to verify that the issue is fixed. Would you like me to rerun the tests for you?
