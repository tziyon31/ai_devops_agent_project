[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the backup process failed due to a "storage quota exceeded" error. This suggests that there is not enough storage space available to complete the backup process.

To resolve this issue, we need to increase the storage quota or free up some space. However, since the available tools do not include options for managing storage directly, we need to consider alternative solutions. 

Given the tools at our disposal, none directly address storage issues. Therefore, the log provides insufficient information to resolve the storage quota problem using the available tools. 

In a real-world scenario, you would need to either increase the storage quota on the storage system or clean up unnecessary files to free up space. If you have access to the storage management system, you should perform these actions outside of the current toolset.
