[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the deployment to the staging environment failed due to "Insufficient disk space." This suggests that the server or environment where the deployment is being attempted does not have enough available disk space to complete the operation.

Unfortunately, I don't have a direct tool to increase disk space. However, I can suggest some general steps that might be taken outside of this toolset:

1. **Free Up Disk Space**: Manually remove unnecessary files or logs from the server to free up space.
2. **Increase Disk Quota**: If possible, increase the disk quota for the server or environment.

Since I can't directly resolve this issue with the available tools, you may need to address the disk space problem manually or with the help of your infrastructure team. Once the disk space issue is resolved, you can rerun the deployment process.
