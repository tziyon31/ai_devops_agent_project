[3] AI REASONING:
The error message in the Jenkins log indicates a "Timeout waiting for response" during the integration tests. This suggests that the operation is taking longer than expected, and the current timeout setting is insufficient.

To resolve this issue, we should increase the timeout duration for the operation. Let's proceed with increasing the timeout.

[4] TOOL RESULT: timeout increased


[5] AI REASONING:
The timeout duration has been successfully increased. This should help prevent the "Timeout waiting for response" error during the integration tests. You can now rerun the integration tests to verify if the issue is resolved.
