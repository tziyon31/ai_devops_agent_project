[3] AI REASONING:
The Jenkins log indicates that the deployment to staging failed due to "Insufficient disk space." This suggests that the server or environment where the deployment is being attempted does not have enough disk space to complete the operation.

To resolve this issue, we need to free up disk space. However, since freeing disk space is not directly available as a tool, we need to consider alternative solutions. In this case, increasing memory or timeout won't help, and freeing a port is unrelated to disk space issues.

Since there is no direct tool to free up disk space, the best course of action is to manually address the disk space issue on the server by removing unnecessary files or increasing the disk capacity. 

If you have any specific tools or actions available for managing disk space, please let me know, and I can guide you further. Otherwise, this issue requires manual intervention to resolve the disk space problem.
