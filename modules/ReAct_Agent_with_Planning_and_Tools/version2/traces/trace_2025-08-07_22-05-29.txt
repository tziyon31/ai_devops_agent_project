Prompt_id: Redis connection pool exhausted
# Total steps: 3
Thought: The log indicates a failure due to the Redis connection pool being exhausted.
Thought: This suggests that the number of available connections to Redis is insufficient for the current load.
Thought: Increasing the number of available connections or freeing up existing ones might resolve the issue.
