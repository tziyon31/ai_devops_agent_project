Prompt_id: 16:05:48 System recovery timeout
# Total steps: 3
Thought: The log indicates a system recovery timeout error during chaos engineering tests.
Thought: A timeout error suggests that the process may need more time to complete.
Thought: To address this, increasing the timeout duration and rerunning the test after the fix could be beneficial.
